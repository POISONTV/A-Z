Hills
as a kid i used to run up hill forts imagening I was an Irish warrior running up a hill and at the top was 
english soldiers with muskeets shooting and i had a stick or something(did it many times)
 
the hill forts of ireland most of them were called "Rath" in irish it was a hillfort to mind lifestock or people 
or people or the protection in case anything ever happened like a keep nearly. my uncle used to tell me it was english . 
he found a cannon ball there before. now this was 1996 about and i now (2017 or 18). I had a friend of mine who does history (Arcelogy)
of it so its a "rath"

to come style of houses through craft work , a skill which is lost in modern society, people cant create anymore
and we have stalled in our evolution as a people when we follow western corporation ideals in goverment and military. 
economics is key (no.1) to winning wars, read "the art of war" by sun tzu to better understand, i know this through observation, in my current state its very hard for me to 
read never mind draw even as an artist. i just follow these thoughts always as a distraction from the truth of my own life, because its more favourable to others !!!! NB 

now back to the HOMES. to be continued ihave a few designs :D
