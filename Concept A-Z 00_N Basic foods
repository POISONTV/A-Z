Foods  (C)(A)(N)

Chemical, adapted & natural

food medicane all the same. we will all work for the knowledge to better ourselves and not by greed but survival 
and future for ourselves to come.

'you know the knowledge to heal yourself' through quick reading & info practices - 

competitive, hunger,but healthy not like modern day where western schools damage education, especially american schooling systems of public schools, 
where mostly people from private schools get ahead in life.

use nature with nature not against

you fear what you dont understand, so you learn , how to get scary naturally! not camel = head in the sand because everybody is running from 
something into big castle towers ect. we are at a time where we know how to run things better but everybody keeps insisting on democracy 
without much thought does it even work or not. 

good intent is followed by good actions, bad intent results in bad actions

Evolution of good actions and moral, not a learned moral, but your right from wrong, good is good! and bad is bad!

both are great examples not milestones.
