True Democracy 
is not in words 
but Observation of your sences 
not everyones opinion 
but your own injustices ! NB

Roots of Life (tree of life) 'the celtic tree' Tribal in the new world of NEO Culture & its downfalls of greed
We repeat, we repent, we Destroy.

PEACE not WAR !
Progressive to mother Earth 

here was a brief statement of important phrases I worked on to grasp a 'concept of peace' which was the origional title but now its 'TRUE DEMOCRACY'
I am a rebel of CORRUPTION AND DISSHONESTY. RESPECT!
