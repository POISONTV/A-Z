Self Disapline - Dont be a sly sneak snitch, be a snake ! sss < S

Depending on upbringing or not find your true disapline to work hard at your desire a system which leads it easy
medium or hard depending how you feel, just keep in mind you work easy you relax easy, but retirement is long and boring. otherwise it is truely 
fullfilling if you have faith :)


people get angry because theyre in a place they dont want to be. so find your place in the world that works for you as 
long as its honest you will triumph.
if its negative you will fail. laws of nature. learn physics if you dont believe me (the only accurate study on nature ie. best guess)
try me i dare you ! too. all for one and one for all. peace over war. forgivness is important of yourself and others, as long as you try your best you cant force people either.

Health care is everyones effort, whats your speciality get to know what it is to help yourself and others.
