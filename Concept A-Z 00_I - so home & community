even in full time relationships

you still have your seperate lives 50/50

possissive & control
of a one sided relationships
wont be tollerated on both sides

if you have kids same story 
50% home & 50 % independant 

self progress. in a safe and bullet proff system 

maybe? survaelenced everyone angle no blind spots

so designing a place thats
priority one is human safety 
and teach them how to combat danger and fear so that people dont 
fear everything one day.

look at a rabit VS a lion 

rabbit runs from everything it see's
and a lion is always calm & fearless. 

lionness is protective and collected, more fearce that a lion to protect. 
men think they are the ones in control but really all along its wemon
look at chess the queen is almighty powerful and the king is a face of its kingdom.
she gives guidence, without a queen the king is powerless in his ambitiion of protecting its people
where the queen only wants to protect its family

A pride of lions and lionesses and cubs Should be our Goal

Love partenership of friends & family 

50/50

of both 

forever

you and everybody needs to live life a little


LEARN, RESPECT, GROW

(SYMBOL tree of life)

NB!
