True Democracy 100%

is not in words, but observation of your sences. <eyes, nose, ears and mouth>
not everyones opinion.
but your own injustices. but respect others not just yourself but to help yourself & others

life & Work! everyday of the week

modern day greek systems dont balance the scales they just overweight one side and expect us to work for pennys, get get richer 
and poor get poorer, especially in recessions the rich sky rocket as well as the poor just go down faster. we need stability
and a reliable system that works for every single person. not just the rich and powerful and preety girls who just took 
daddys credit card. we need a system of not bullys but an equal partnership of respect, honor and future of us, the planet and every 
living thing. respect even the plants and animals. not bully them because we think were more intelligent or that we have the power to.

find out your history of family and yourself to know better about YOU! see the simularitys objectievly & honestly. 

honesty is always the best policy

olympics is questionable it bases gold = greed, silver = honour, 3rd cheap copper. its based on a first second third word or a 
winners get everything and honor is just to protect the greedy maybe, and maybe from the poor ie copper.

I think we should only have Silver = honor & glory, & Bronze = good competation and good friendship, no hard feelings, were all here to live together

dont do it for a gold trophy but an honourable one! an honourable future, not a greedy one. were all here to live life with friends and
family. just because someones on a power trip dowsnt mean we have to live our lives like that! think about that one
