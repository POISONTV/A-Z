neuron Foods
CURRY, BROCALLI, WALNUTS, CRAB, CHICKPEAS OR CARBANZOBEANS, BUCKWHEAT, BREWERS YEAST (SOMETHING FISHY WITH THAT ONE THO), MARMITE

OMEGA 3

BUT I THINK OMEGA 6 AND SATURATED FAT IS MUCH BETTER. SATURATED FAT IS IN BREAST MILK. keep closer to basics. we evolved 
this way for a reason. keep that in mind, what did the cave man eat, or more specifically 
what did the gorilla eat (only bannanas!) because he is fat in order to be full he must eat  
more of them just to maintain satification of hunger. think about it??? and reasearch it ie. fat gorilla

brain development food
walnuts, Greens, 

brain foods 
blueberry, tumeric, pumpkin seed(?), walnuts, Brocalli!, Dark choclate(i think makes your motivation lazy because your brain is rewarded so so very easily with dopeamine 
or serotonin, well doesnt work much for me really ever). nuts (walnuts!!! :) )
